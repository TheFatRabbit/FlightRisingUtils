# FlightRisingUtils
This is the source code for the private tools I create for Flight Rising. The `colihelper.py` file interfaces with [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwmETJiAFoNSi3eYZSI-qlggqG4aSTpBsepA9pO9Jgs/edit?usp=sharing).<br>
For my public Glimmer and Gloom Very Hard Solver, go [here](https://github.com/TheFatRabbit/glimmer-and-gloom-very-hard-solver).<br>
If you wish to modify this program for your own use, feel free to reach out to `thefatrabbit` on Discord. I currently have no plans to make this program work for any devices other than my own.
